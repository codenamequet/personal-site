    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
        <p><img src="marquet.png" alt="marquet" align="left">I started my career at Cyveillance in February 2011 as an open source intelligence intern on the former HITT team, focused on the insurance industry. While on the HITT team I developed my knowledge of the cyber security industry, including but not limited to cyber intelligence, malware, and network security. After working as an intern for five months I became a full time employee working for clients primarily in the insurance industry. I became a member of the Brand Protection team in 2013 focusing on successful migrating brand protection, partner compliance, and distribution control reports over to the SOC and helping make brand protection a profitable business. Currently, I am a member of the Brand Protection team as a Senior Intelligence Analyst in charge of training new analyst and champion of several proprietary software programs. In addition I am also working on continuing the growth of the Brand Protection team with the hope of developing more reports.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a degree in Information System Security and Software Development and Security from the College of Southern Maryland and University of Maryland University College. In addition to college courses, I have also has taken online classes and done outside research to become more proficient in intelligence gathering, computer and network security, project management, and several programming languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. With this knowledge I am in the process of starting my own design company CODENAME:MDR, focusing on web development and graphic design. I am also working on a obtaining a certified web developer and Security+ certification.</p>
